Progress
Rating: 8/10
This week, I've made significant progress on my Maze Project, completing the scoring system, audio effects, and leaderboard integration. I've also conducted thorough testing and bug fixing, ensuring the game is stable and functional. However, I encountered some unexpected challenges with the scoring system and audio effects implementation, which slightly delayed my progress.
Completed as planned:
Implemented scoring system and leaderboard
Added audio effects and background music
Conducted thorough testing and bug fixing
Incomplete:
Polishing the UI and adding additional features (e.g., level editor, high scores)
Optimizing game performance for smoother gameplay
I'm pleased with my progress this week, despite the minor setbacks. I'm confident that I'll complete the remaining tasks and deliver a high-quality Maze game project.
Challenges
Technical Challenge:
The most difficult technical challenge I encountered in this second week was implementing the scoring system and leaderboard integration. I initially underestimated the complexity of designing a fair and engaging scoring system that would accurately reflect player progress and performance. I spent a significant amount of time researching and experimenting with different approaches, but I struggled to find a solution that met my requirements.
Additionally, integrating the leaderboard feature proved to be more challenging than expected. I had to ensure that the leaderboard accurately reflected player scores and rankings in real-time, which required implementing a robust and efficient data storage and retrieval system. I encountered several issues with data consistency and synchronization, which further complicated the process.
To overcome these challenges, I had to dedicate extra time to researching and learning new concepts, such as data structures and algorithms. I also sought guidance from my mentor and peers, which helped me to identify and address potential issues earlier on. Through persistence and hard work, I was able to successfully implement the scoring system and leaderboard integration, which has significantly enhanced the overall gameplay experience.
Non-Technical Challenge:
The most difficult non-technical challenge I encountered in this second week was time management and self-motivation. As an individual working on this project, I had to rely on my own discipline and motivation to stay on track and meet deadlines. However, I found it challenging to maintain a consistent work pace and prioritize tasks effectively, especially when faced with unexpected technical issues.
At times, I felt overwhelmed and frustrated with the setbacks, which affected my motivation and productivity. To overcome this challenge, I had to develop a more structured work schedule and set realistic goals for each day. I also made a conscious effort to take regular breaks and practice self-care, which helped to reduce stress and maintain my overall well-being. By acknowledging and addressing these non-technical challenges, I was able to stay focused and motivated, ensuring that I continued to make progress on my project.

Screenshots
Here are two screenshots of my Maze game project:
Screenshot 1: Game Interface



This screenshot shows the main game interface, where the player navigates through the maze, collects power-ups, and avoids obstacles. The score and leaderboard are displayed at the top, providing real-time feedback on the player's progress.
Screenshot 2: Leaderboard and Scoring System

This screenshot highlights the leaderboard and scoring system, which displays player rankings, scores, and progress. The scoring system rewards players for completing specific tasks and achieving milestones, providing an engaging and challenging experience.
These screenshots demonstrate the progress I've made on my Maze game project, showcasing the game's interface, mechanics, and features.
